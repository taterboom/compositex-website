# Introduction

CompositeX is an efficient and powerful browser extension that can help you manage functional scripts more easily. By writing separate functional nodes and combining them into a Pipeline, CompositeX provides greater flexibility and efficiency.
The basic unit of CompositeX is the Node, which functions like a pure function, processing input information and outputting it, as well as containing some configurations.

Combining several Nodes forms a Pipeline, where the input of the Pipeline is the input of the first Node, and the output of the Pipeline is the output of the last Node, with the input of other Nodes being the output of the previous Node.

Compared to directly writing scripts to implement a particular function, CompositeX has several advantages:

- The progress of execution can be seen through the UI provided by CompositeX.
- The workflow can be expanded through different parameter configurations.
- More functions can be easily added or removed from the Pipeline's Nodes.
